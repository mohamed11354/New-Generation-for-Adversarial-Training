# Benchmark

We have built an benchmark for exploring transability between different models with different capacity. The dataset created using 8 models that consists of 4 different main architectures: DenseNet, ResNet, EfficientNet and ViT. Each architecture has two weights: normal weights from TensorFlow and adversarial weights that we trained. These models are surrogate models for MIG attack. The attack hyperparameters follows the recommendation from the original paper. 

Here is some results from dataset:
